ObjLibrary Development Log
==========================



2012 Jan 27 (1:00)
------------------

Released to CS409



2012 Jan 27 (4:30)
------------------

1. draw() no longer crashes when a material refernces an image that cannot be loaded.
2. Added support for Tf command in MTL files
3. Added warning for entirely-transparent material

Released to CS809



2012 Jan 30
-----------

1. Images now load correctly when a bad image is specified first



2012 Feb 1
----------

1. Added SpriteFont.h/.cpp



2012 Feb 3
----------

1. Fixed Vector.cpp constructor



2012 Feb 7
----------

1. Added function to draw an ObjModel with the materials in an MTL library with a specific filename.



2012 Feb 14
-----------

1. Decreased the percision of the isNormal()/isUnit() function in Vector3.  A Vector3 normalized with the normalize() (or getNormalized() ) function should now count as normalized.
2. Fixed getDisplayList() in the ObjModel class to not include loading the texture in the display list it returns.  This makes drawing the model 5ish times faster.
3. Added function to draw an ObjModel without activating its materials.



2012 Feb 27
-----------

1. Added "#include <string>" to TextureManager.h.
2. draw in SpriteFont no long sets shading mode to GL_FLAT.



2012 Feb 28
-----------

1. Added "#include <cstdlib>" to MtlLibrary.h.
2. Added "#include <cstring>" to TextureManager.h.



2012 March 15
-------------

1. Fixed constructors in Vector.cpp to accept 0 length without crashing.



2012 March 24
-------------

1. Reversed internal ordering in BoundedGrid to match C++.
2. Added Bounded3DGrid



2012 March 30
-------------

1. Reversed rotation on rotateAroundY to match rotateAroundX and rotateAroundZ in Vector3 class.



2012 April 25
-------------

1. Fiddled with sort() in BoundedArray.
2. Added explicit typecasts to file reading in Functions.cpp.
3. Added default bump multiplier to MtlLibrary.cpp.
4. Changed internal constants to unsigned int in ObjModel.
5. Removed unreachable invariant test from TextureBmp.cpp.

2012 May 10
-----------

1. Added mirrorX() and mirrorY() functions to TextureBmp.



2012 August 30
--------------

1. Added more font sheets for the SpriteFont class to use.  There are now 9.



2012 September 4
----------------

1. Changed all preprocessor directives from __FILENAME_H__ to FILENAME_H to comply with C++ language specifications: "__" is reserved for compiler-defined macros.



2012 September 19
-----------------

1. Changed source files for BoundedArray, PriorityQueue, and Vector from .cpp to .inl.



2012 September 26
-----------------

1. Added Manhatten distance and chessboard distance functions to Vector3 class.  Documentation for existing distance functions now explicitly refer to Euclidean distance.
2. Added getRotationX/Y/Z to Vector3.



2012 November 27
----------------

1. Added negation operator to Vector3 class.
2. Added isFinite check to Vector3 class.
3. Changed source files for BoundedGrid, Bounded3DGrid, and CircularArray from .cpp to .inl.
4. Fixed print function in BoundedGrid and Bounded3DGrid classes.
5. Removed superfluous include to Functions.h from CircularArray.inl.
6. Added a few more assert tests.



2013 January 8
--------------

1. Added component-wise multiplication and division to Vector3 class.
2. Fixed a few minor documentation errors in Vector3.h and added a few more assert tests.
3. Added init function to TextureBmp to create a blank image of a specified size.
4. Added Vector2 class.
5. TextureManager class now flips Bmp textures files after loading to match Maya's interpretation.  Previously matched Wavefront documentation (I think).



2013 January 20
---------------

1. Added #include <cstdlib> to ObjModel.cpp - required for atoi function.
2. Changed return type of isDistanceLessThan function in Vector2 and Vector3 to bool (was double).
3. Changed random functions in Random.cpp to random0, random1, random2 to avoid POSIX name conflicts.
4. Replaced call to _isfinite function in Vector3.cpp with platform-resolving macro.  Currently non-windows just returns true instead of checking.
5. Added #include <string> to CircularArray.inl for NULL constant.



2013 January 25
---------------

1. Changed implementation of random0 to avoid integer wraparound on g++.
2. ObjModel class now used Vector2 class to represent texture coordinates instead of custom type.
3. Added optional (macro-controlled) support for loading .png images (using third-party libraries).
4. Loading errors from an MTL file now go in the error file/stream specified for the OBJ file the requires it instead of to stderr.
5. Replaced call to _isfinite function in Vector2.cpp as in Vector3.cpp.
6. Added error message for loading invalid texture type.



2013 March 18
-------------

1. Added isNormLessThan() function to Vector2 and Vector3.
2. Modified texture flip to apply to all textures, not just BMP files.



2013 March 25
-------------

1. Added isNormGreaterThan() function to Vector2 and Vector3.



2013 March 26
-------------

1. Added isDistanceGreaterThan() function to Vector2 and Vector3.



2013 March 28
-------------

1. Added newline at end of Random.cpp to fix POSIX compile errors.



2013 May 14
-----------

1. Fixed add() functions in TextureManager to convert internal names with lowercase.  Previously, names with uppercase characters prevented texture being selected from list, defaulting to reloading the file.



2013 June 14
------------

1. Replaced all Vector<>s with std::vector<>s.
2. Vector<> is no longer required to display OBJ models.
3. Warnings in MtlLibrary for entirely transparent materials now print to logfile instead of standard output.
4. Component-wise multiplication must now be explictly specified for Vector2 and Vector3 instead of being the overloaded meaning of the multiplication operator.
5. Added setSize() function to BoundedGrid.



2013 June 15
------------

1. Added in-place rotation functions to Vector2 and Vector3.
2. Renamed texture_manager namespace to TextureMnager to comply to conventions.
3. Added isEmpty() function to ObjModel.



2013 June 21
------------

1. Renamed Bounded3DGrid<> to Bounded3dGrid<>.
2. Changed default sizes of BoundedGrid<> and Bounded3dGrid<> to static member constants from global constants in anonymous namespaces.  The namespaces were being included in any file the classes were used, which lead to conflicts.
3. Added non-const get function to BoundedGrid<> and Bounded3dGrid<>.



2013 July 22
------------

1. Added versions isNormLessThan and isNormGreaterThan functions that compare to another vector insteead of a scaler.



2014 January 20
---------------

1. Added templated UpdatablePriorityQueue.



2014 January 24
---------------

1. Updated documentation in Vector2/3.h to say class instead of record.
2. Fixed bug where setUp2dView function in SpriteFont crashed if given a non-postitive window size.  This happens if you minimize the window.
